# Insurance-Fraud-Detection

The objective of the project is to predict whether a claim is fraudulent or not given a number
of factors provided when each claim is made. For this classification problem, the following
modelling techniques that will be implemented are as follows:

- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression with SMOTE
- Random Forest
- XGBoost


The models built in this project were trained on the training set and tested and tuned using
the test set created.


The selected model was evaluated further using the validation dataset and performed well in
making predictions on unseen data. According to the selected model, the five most important
features for predicting fraud in insurance claims are:
- faults by a third party
- an insurance base policy that provides coverage for liability only
- the age of the policyholder
- GDP per capita atthe time of the accident
- insurance base policy coverage for collision only.
